# ðŸ‘‰What is Software Engineering?

## Software Engineer Responsibilities:

- Write and test code.
- Consult with stakeholders, third-party vendors, security specialists, and other team members.
- Design, build, and maintain software systems.

## Software engineer vs Software developer:

**Software engineers build systems while software developers implement specific functionalities**

# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

## What is SDLC

The SDLC provides a systematic process for software development:

- The SDLC was developed because of a need for a systematic approach.
SDLC advantages include:
- Risk reduction and improved efficiency.
- Facilitates communication.
- Team members know their responsibilities.
- Iteration allows for changing requirements.

</p>

The SDLC can be divided into six phases:

1. Planning: requirement gathering, creating SRS
2. Design: Transform requirements into code
3. Development: coding
4. Testing: identify and fix bugs
5. Deployment: code released to the production environment
6. Maintenance: stakeholder feedback, issues/bugs identified, code enhancements suggested

## How to build quality software:

To build quality software, you need some common software engineering processes:

- Requirement gathering
- Design
- Coding for quality
- Testing
- Releases
- Documenting

### Requirement gathering :

Testing includes also :

- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Systeme testing
- User Acceptance

### Releases :

## Documenting :

---

- **System documenting:**
    
    README files, inline comments, architecture and design, documents, verification information, and maintenance, guides
    
- **User documentation:**
    
    User guides, instructional videos, manuals, online and inline help
    

### Requirements :

---
- **The requirement gathering process** entails identifying stakeholders, establishing goals and objectives, eliciting, documenting, confirming, and then prioritizing requirements.
- **The SRS documents functional**, external, system, and non-functional requirements.
- The URS documents user stories.
- **The SRS documents system capabilities** and acceptance criteria, as well as policy, regulation, personnel, performance, security, and hardware requirements.
